This Program provides 6 cryptos in total including 4 Homomorphic cryptos:

1.DESede
2.ECIES
3.ELGAMAL
4.RSA
5.PAILLIER
6.EXPONENTIAL ELGAMAL

Using integer from 1 to 6 (-1 to quit) to specify a scheme.

After your selection, you will get information about the encryption and decryption result, 
the time each operation costs, input length as well as key size.

Besides, it will check its homomorphic properties, both addictive and multiplicative property, print out the result.
